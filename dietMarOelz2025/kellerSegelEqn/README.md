This programme is for problem 2 of Assignemnt 2, from the short course on PDEs for mathmeatical biology by Dr.  Dietmar Oelz, University of Queensland, lectures being delivered at IIT Delhi, June 2025.

This problem is about Keller Segel Model. As you can see that the finite difference algorithm kind of fails here because of requirement of very small step-size in time. How can you improve this?
